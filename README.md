The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to perform a thorough comparison of plotnine (the equivalent of R's ggplot2 package), written by Hassan Kibirige, against the native ggplot2. The comparison is made possible by means of rpy2, a high-level interface designed to facilitate the use of R by Python programmers. We use the R magic command %load_ext to load the rpy2 IPython extension into the notebook, essentially initializing the R interface and allowing the notebook to connect and pass objects between the two languages.
